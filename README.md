# MoviesManager

MoviesManager is a web application that allows you to add, delete and display ordered lists of movies based on their rating. It consists of three independent modules that communicate wit each other and provide:
* fantastic user experience (front-end application using HTM5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 and Angular 5)
* robust server operations (back-end spring boot application exposing REST endpoints)
* flexible persistence mechanism (MongoDB database).

More specific description of each modules can be found in subdirectories.
